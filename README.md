# test-NodeJSJunior

To run this repository:

1 - Install all dependencies on both projects, for node and angular. (i.e. yarn add or npm install)
2 - Inside the backend/src/database folder, is the MongoDB conection file. I might leave it as is with my cluster for now, but that may change soon.
3 - Run both projects (yarn dev or npm run dev) for backend, ng serve --open for frontend.
4 - Feel free to ask any questions or send me any feedback. I'm still learning both Angular and Node, so there is a lot of room for improvement. 

You might find me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-salgado-8b90b0186/)

A ReactJS version of this frontend might come soon.
